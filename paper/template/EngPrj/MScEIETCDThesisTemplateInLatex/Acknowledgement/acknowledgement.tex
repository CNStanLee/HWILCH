I must acknowledge the input of the academy for giving me the trumpet I used on the first day of shooting. Without the Jabberwock there would have been no end to this work. Despite my best efforts my supervisor managed to get me to produce something readable, factual and reproducible. A great vote of thanks must go to my parents for not calling me so much during the time of the write up and my aunt for sending me cake. My friends were always there with a beer and hacked code when I needed it. The one time I had to design a circuit the technicians at the Department went all out to help me and I am truly grateful. Finally, I must thank my dog Abel for making me walk every day.
