\chapter{Installing the Hole in the Head}

The {\em Hole in the Head} is an old Greek ritual used as a cleansing process for those leaving military training school. It works equally well in the modern day where the process is significantly reduced in complexity through the use of mobile phones. In the time of the ancient Greeks the process began at sunrise on the morning of the last day of education. A councillor would berate the students for about 1 hour until the sun was full in the sky and then hand out salt sticks which were consumed before the first sweat bead hit the ground.  

Today, students need only to tap their YouTube app and watch for about 12 minutes a day for about 5 days. After this time they find that the ability to ignore apps on the phone is gone, and they are no longer able to differentiate between information from an unauthenticated, automated blog and information from a book written by a person. This also has the knock on effect of a loss of spelling and grammar abilities and subsequently an increase in the use of acronyms and graphics for expression. Having completed this now seamlessly painless exercise, students may go forth and seek employment in companies making those apps.
